# Building Your Own Docker Image

This guide will teach you how to build LobeHub Docker images from source code. Building your own image is useful if you need custom builds or want to use a specific code version.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure your system has:

- **Docker**: Version 20.10 or higher
- **Git**: For cloning the repository
- At least **8GB** of available memory (for the build process)
- At least **10GB** of available disk space

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the LobeHub repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat.git
cd lobe-chat
```

### 2. Use Build Scripts

LobeHub provides convenient build scripts:

#### International Version

```bash
npm run self-hosting:docker
```

This will build an image named `lobehub:local`.

#### China Version (Using Domestic Mirrors for Acceleration)

If you're in mainland China, use this command for faster builds:

```bash
npm run self-hosting:docker-cn
```

This will build an image named `lobehub-local` (with tag `latest`) using domestic mirror sources.

### 3. Manual Build (Advanced)

You can also use Docker commands directly for finer control:

```bash
docker build -t lobehub:custom .
```

#### Using Build Arguments

The Dockerfile supports multiple build arguments to customize the build process:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg USE_CN_MIRROR=true \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/chat \
  --build-arg FEATURE_FLAGS=enable_new_feature \
  -t lobehub:custom \
  .
```

**Available Build Arguments:**

| Parameter | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `USE_CN_MIRROR` | Use Chinese mirror sources to accelerate build | `false` | `true` |
| `NODEJS_VERSION` | Node.js version | `24` | `24` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` | Base path for the application | - | `/chat` |
| `FEATURE_FLAGS` | Feature flags | - | `enable_experimental` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry DSN (error tracking) | - | `https://xxx@sentry.io/xxx` |

<Callout type="tip">
  **About USE_CN_MIRROR:** This parameter switches to domestic npm mirror sources (npmmirror.com)
  and Debian mirror sources (USTC), significantly improving build speeds in mainland China.
</Callout>

## Running the Built Image

After building, you can run the image using:

### Basic Run

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3210:3210 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@host.docker.internal:5432/postgres \
  -e KEY_VAULTS_SECRET=your-secret-key \
  -e AUTH_SECRET=your-auth-secret \
  -e JWKS_KEY='{"keys":[...]}' \
  -e APP_URL=http://localhost:3210 \
  --name lobehub \
  lobehub:local
```

### Using Environment Variable Files

A more recommended approach is using a `.env` file:

```bash
# 1. Create lobe-chat.env file
cat > lobe-chat.env << EOF
APP_URL=http://localhost:3210
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@host.docker.internal:5432/postgres
KEY_VAULTS_SECRET=your-secret-key
AUTH_SECRET=your-auth-secret
JWKS_KEY={"keys":[...]}
# Add other environment variables...
EOF

# 2. Run using environment variable file
docker run -d \
  -p 3210:3210 \
  --env-file lobe-chat.env \
  --name lobehub \
  lobehub:local
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Ensure all required environment variables are provided. For a complete list of environment
  variables, see the [Environment Variables documentation](/docs/self-hosting/environment-variables).
</Callout>

## Build Optimization Tips

### 1. Use Docker Build Cache

Docker automatically caches build layers, making rebuilds faster:

```bash
# Clear build cache (if you need a complete rebuild)
docker builder prune

# Build without cache
docker build --no-cache -t lobehub:local .
```

### 2. Multi-stage Build Optimization

LobeHub's Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds to reduce final image size:

- **base stage**: Prepare base environment and dependencies, including Node.js runtime and necessary system libraries
- **builder stage**: Install dependencies and build the application
- **app stage**: Collect files needed for runtime
- **production stage**: Final minimized image (using `scratch` as base, but includes complete runtime environment copied from app stage)

This is a "distroless" build pattern where the final image contains only the minimal set of files needed to run, approximately **600MB**.

### 3. Build Specific Versions

If you want to build a specific version of LobeHub:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat.git
cd lobe-chat

# Switch to specific version tag
git checkout v1.0.0

# Build
npm run self-hosting:docker
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failure: Out of Memory

**Error Message:**

```
FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
```

**Solution:**

The Dockerfile already sets `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192`, but if you still encounter issues, ensure Docker has enough allocated memory (at least 8GB).

In Docker Desktop: Settings → Resources → Memory, adjust to at least 8GB.

### Build Failure: Network Timeout

**Error Message:**

```
npm ERR! network request timeout
```

**Solution:**

1. Use domestic mirror build (for China users):

```bash
npm run self-hosting:docker-cn
```

2. Or configure Docker proxy

### Image Size Too Large

LobeHub uses multi-stage builds; the final image should be around 600MB. If the image size is abnormally large:

1. Ensure you're using the latest Dockerfile
2. Check that `.dockerignore` file exists (should exclude `node_modules`, `.next`, etc.)
3. Clean Docker build cache:

```bash
docker builder prune -a
```

### Runtime Error: Database Connection Failed

Ensure:

1. Database URL is correct
2. If the database is local, use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost`
3. Database is started and accessible

## Uploading to Your Own Docker Hub

If you want to upload your built image to your own Docker Hub account for use on other servers or sharing with your team, follow these steps:

### 1. Login to Docker Hub

First, login with your Docker Hub account:

```bash
docker login
```

You'll be prompted to enter your Docker Hub username and password.

<Callout type="tip">
  It's recommended to use a [Docker Hub Access Token](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security) instead of your password for better security.
</Callout>

### 2. Tag the Image

Tag your built image with your Docker Hub repository format:

```bash
# Format: docker tag local-image-name yourusername/repository-name:tag
docker tag lobehub:local yourusername/lobehub:latest
docker tag lobehub:local yourusername/lobehub:v1.0.0
```

**Tag Naming Suggestions:**

- `latest` - Latest version
- `v1.0.0` - Specific version number
- `20240210` - Date tag
- `dev` - Development version

You can add multiple tags to the same image.

### 3. Push the Image

Push the tagged image to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push yourusername/lobehub:latest
docker push yourusername/lobehub:v1.0.0
```

The push process may take a few minutes, depending on your network speed and image size (approximately 600MB).

### 4. Use on Other Servers

After a successful push, you can pull and use your image on any server:

```bash
docker pull yourusername/lobehub:latest

docker run -d \
  -p 3210:3210 \
  --env-file lobe-chat.env \
  --name lobehub \
  yourusername/lobehub:latest
```

### Complete Example

Here's the complete workflow from build to push:

```bash
# 1. Build the image
npm run self-hosting:docker

# 2. Login to Docker Hub
docker login

# 3. Tag the image (replace yourusername with your username)
docker tag lobehub:local yourusername/lobehub:latest
docker tag lobehub:local yourusername/lobehub:v2.0.0

# 4. Push to Docker Hub
docker push yourusername/lobehub:latest
docker push yourusername/lobehub:v2.0.0

# 5. Verify upload (optional)
docker pull yourusername/lobehub:latest
```

### Private Repositories

If you don't want to share your image publicly, you can create a private repository on Docker Hub:

1. Visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)
2. When creating a new repository, select "Private"
3. Use the same push commands

<Callout type="warning">
  Free Docker Hub accounts can only create one private repository. For more private repositories, consider using other container registry services like Alibaba Cloud Container Registry, Tencent Cloud TCR, GitHub Container Registry, etc.
</Callout>

### Using Other Container Registries

Besides Docker Hub, you can also use other container registries:

#### GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)

```bash
# Login to GitHub
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin

# Tag and push
docker tag lobehub:local ghcr.io/yourusername/lobehub:latest
docker push ghcr.io/yourusername/lobehub:latest
```

#### Alibaba Cloud Container Registry

```bash
# Login to Alibaba Cloud
docker login --username=your-aliyun-username registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com

# Tag and push
docker tag lobehub:local registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/your-namespace/lobehub:latest
docker push registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/your-namespace/lobehub:latest
```

## Differences from Official Images

Self-built images are functionally identical to official images on Docker Hub (`lobehub/lobehub`). The main differences are:

| Item | Official Image | Self-built |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Source** | Automatically built by GitHub Actions | Built locally |
| **Validation** | Tested by official team | Self-testing required |
| **Updates** | Automatically published new versions | Manual rebuild required |
| **Customization** | Cannot modify | Can modify source code |
| **Build Time** | No waiting | 15-30 minutes |
| **Storage Location** | lobehub/lobehub | Under your account |
